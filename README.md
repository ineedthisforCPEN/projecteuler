# projecteuler

Solving [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems using Python.

The goal is to provide a flexible and scalable interface that allows users to run different "versions" (e.g. a brute force version or a smarter version) of each problem's solution. Eventually, I plan on adding some C code to improve the performance of some (or all) of the solutions.
